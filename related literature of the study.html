This part provides articles or readings taken from various sources like books, some researchers,
publications, newspapers and the internet which serve as reference of the researchers in relation to
their study on the impact of an eco-friendly and versatile backpack in the environment and to the
drafting students of Marikina Polytechnic College.

<b>Eco-friendly Product</b>
<br />
<br />
Daniel Holzer (2018) defines eco-friendly as earth-friendly or does not contribute any harm to the
environment. The term usually refers to products that contribute to green living, which helps in
conserving resources such as water and energy. Similarly, Merriam-Webster states that the official
definition of eco-friendly is not environmentally harmful. Also, an eco-friendly product is considered
safe for the environment from production to packaging. (Amina Lake Abdelrahman, 2022)
<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the definition presented, the terms eco-friendly and environmentally-friendly are broad
terms and the reason why there are plenty of articles on Google attempting to answer a question
regarding eco-friendly products. (Alyssa Mertes, 2020)
<br />
<br />
<br />
In contrast to Daniel Holzer (2018) and Amina Lake Abdelrahman (2022), Eco-friendly products can
be defined as products that are less harmful to nature. However, eco-friendly products cannot
entirely replace non-biodegradable products. The hygienic standards of the eco-friendly products
could be inappropriate. Also, eco-friendly products are expensive due to its high-cost raw materials.
(Saurabh Chaudhary, 2020)
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to Wikipedia, sustainable products provide environmental, social, as well as economic
benefits while protecting public health at the same time. Jo Vieira (2019) explains it even further by
presenting three main things that make a product sustainable, including life-cycle orientation, dual
focus and also, significant improvements. Moreover, eco-friendly, environmentally-friendly or
sustainable is the narrowest of the terms, and can directly define any product with no harm to
ecosystems.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Eco-friendly products are expensive for a variety of reasons. First, due to a lack of demand, there
are not enough people currently purchasing sustainable products. Second, because of high
manufacturing costs, many eco-friendly companies pay their workers a fair living wage. Therefore,
the items need to be expensive enough in order for them to support the pay. (Eric, 2021)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Amy Emmert (2021) demonstrates the popularity of eco-friendly products when the pandemic began.
According to her, people have become a little more sensitive to the environmental impact of buying
products. In fact, a survey called the Global Consumer Insights Pulse Survey, conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2021, shows that consumers around the globe have become even more
eco-friendly.
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the Manila Bulletin, seventy-five percent (75%) of Filipino consumers prefer brands that
are eco-friendly and sustainable as well. To follow, the Who Cares, Who Does by Kantar, also
known for being the world’s leading data, insights, and consulting group, revealed that Filipino
consumers today are stepping forward to become more responsible consumers. Furthermore, the
pandemic puts an emphasis on the significance of wellness and health for consumers. (Bernie
Cahiles-Magkilat, 2021)

<b>Eco-friendly Backpack</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />
Candice Batista (2022) explains that an eco-friendly backpack is supposed to be green, convenient,
spacious, and sustainable enough to carry things, whether commuting to school or the office.
Additionally, backpacks must be made from natural, organic or recycled fabrics.
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to the Eco Market, eco-friendly fabrics are generally made or produced from crops that do
not need any type of chemical to grow. It is known for being softer but durable. Like a typical fabric,
sustainable fabrics can also be referred to as man-made fabrics but more from renewable sources,
primarily wood or bamboo (Harper, Douglas et al., 2012).
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comparatively, leather is also a great choice in terms of sustainability. Meanwhile, leather can also
be considered a natural fabric made from tanned animal products, which remains one of the most
desirable textiles due to its durability. Which also remains the most popular textile around the world
(Avni Dutta, 2021).
<br />
<br />
<br />
The researchers will be using fabric and leather together to produce a more sustainable backpack.
Meanwhile, Bhavya, Raji, Selvarani, Samrot, Javad, and Appalaraju (2019) explicates the involved
processes in leather making. Tanning is an important process. However, it could cause various ill
effects. Therefore, it is replaced with vegetable tanning, where the method is as easy as it is eco-
friendly.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Loma Prietta (2018) differentiates the fabric from leather by stating that fabric is made from some
fiber, namely, wool, cashmere, camel, alpaca, and some other fiberous plant tissues, particularly
bamboo, cotton, soy, and so on. While leather is always the dried and dyed skin of animal. He added
that the process and composition of chemicals required in order to make products are different.
<br />
<br />
<br />
William Hunter (2018) agreed to the statement of Loma Prietta (2018). He elaborates it in a simple
way, like, leather is not a fabric due to the fact that fabrics are fabricated. whereas leather is a
natural material. For instance, leather is, however, used like a fabric. It is stitched together in order to
form garments and more.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Popular eco-friendly and sustainable backpacks</b>
<br />
<br />
The Patagonia backpack is known to be one of the most popular backpack brands on the market.
Consumers are always coming back year after year due to its quality and durability, which are
important factors. Next would be the versatility of the backpack, which can be used for a variety of
activities. and also because it is eco-friendly, since sustainability plays a huge factor in that company
(Haydon, 2022).
<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the first brand, the Matt and Nat backpack is also a popular backpack brand and is made
using vegan leather. The products from this brand cause less harm to the environment. Moreover,
the name Matt means materials while Nat means nature, which suggests that the environment, in
this brand, is the priority (Sam, 2020).
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the Philippines, a traditional backpack called pasiking is made of woven rattan. The extracted
fibres of a very long-leafed pineapple plant are what make the covering water-proof. This bag is
used for carrying equipment, materials, and goods (Markus Kittner, 2012).
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sam (2020) gives an explanation of the importance of an eco-friendly backpack. A normal backpack
is typically made from modified plastic-like materials that will likely become a problem once the
backpack is damaged and thrown in the garbage because it lasts a hundred years in the
environment. While an eco-friendly backpack, as the name suggests, is made of non-polluting eco-
friendly materials that emerge rapidly. Furthermore, this backpack helps in reducing the severity of
the serious environmental crisis the world is currently facing. Also, it preserves the environment for
future generations.
<br />
<br />
<br />
In connection with the eco-friendly backpack, American actress Sophia Bush is a passionate
philanthropist whose causes focus on the celebration of the arts and also the environment. She is
mostly seen in public carrying a bag that is made from eco-conscious cloth, like cotton. (Andrea
Cheng, 2016)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Filipino actress Kim Chui, on the other hand, prefers a leather type of backpack when traveling,
because with the said backpack, it is easy for her to organize and get her stuffs with its many
compartments and also sustainable. (Andeng Fernandez, 2016)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Carry Hq (2016) explicates the things he has to haul around on a daily basis as an architect, whether
visiting a site for some inspection or meeting up with a potential client. He then said the things he
had to take with him, namely, drafting pens, sketch paper, tracing paper, rolled drawings,
architectural scale rules, compact camera, and a survey kit.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rafael Pinoy, an architect from De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, shares his architectural
backpack and its contents. He then said that he decided to show it, the bag that carries his treasures
from home to office. The contents include such things as a hard drive, a netbook, pencils and pens,
a pencil case, a laptop mouse and pad, and chargers. (Bob Borson, 2013)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Similarly, Mark Joshua Pineda (2014) gives an insight into the things inside the bag of an
architecture student from Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila. The interviewee is using a
Samsonite Y Series Backpack, she said. It is perfect for a student who carries a large laptop for
some rendering 3D model purposes. The compartments help her be organized. The things she
brings to class when they are going to make or submit plates are: triangle scale, laptop, compass,
pens, markers, tapes, long clear books, notebooks, rolled plates, and a T-square. Then, she added,
minor subject syllabi are not included.
<br />
<br />
<br />
In contrast to Mark Joshua Pineda (2014), carrying a heavy backpack may lead to some serious
problems. Students are likely prone to acquiring musculoskeletal disorders. Many factors are there,
psychosocially and physically. One such factor would be the postural changes brought about by
carrying school bags. Moreover, previous research has been established showing the effect on
posture and spinal curvature in school due to carrying heavy backpacks (De Gruyter, 2019).
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, like every drafting and architecture student, engineering students also carry backpacks
where they put things for study. Their things are also bulky, to the point that a sustainable backpack
is a must. The things that can be seen in an engineering student’s bag include a pen or pencil, a
scientific calculator, a notebook or newsprint, a laptop, different rulers, a T-square, drawing plates,
and textbooks. (Suad Alkhoury, 2022)
<br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, another engineer also shares the things he keeps in the bag. He began by mentioning
the important qualities a bag should have. The bag must be durable and comfortable. It also has
pockets that can be easily accessed. So, the things he keeps in his backpack, namely, a laptop, a
paper and pen, books, an external SSD, phone cables, plate drawings, rulers, and body
accessories. (Ben Church, 2018)
<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the frequently mentioned materials is tracing paper or drawing plates or large types of paper
for plates, which drafting students store in a device known as a drafting tube. According to Yusra
Ansari (2020), a drafting tube is a storage device that is the most efficient way for carrying important
large drawing sheets safely as it requires less space. The most effective method for architects,
drafters, and engineers to hold tracing papers and other large papers.
<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the first tool, another frequently mentioned tool is the T-square. A research study
explains the said tool and its uses. A T-square is known to be a basic drafting tool, and the primary
focus of it is to create horizontal parallel lines. It is likely an upgraded straightedge, which helps
drafters draw accurate, properly placed lines with ease. Mostly, T-squares are large in size, usually
the same size as a backpack (Jaylin Merring, 2015).
<br />
<br />
<br />
Consequently, drafting, architecture, or engineering students almost have the same things to keep in
their backpack. Moreover, the Tod’s shape-shifting backpack is best for those requiring versatility. It
has multiple carrying modes; it could be either a regular backpack or a briefcase with two leather
carry handles. The versatility makes it ideal for carrying to school or work. Additionally, FREITAG
Dragnet Back is convenient for drafting, architecture, and engineering students due to the fact that it
is environmentally-friendly. The bag is made from recycled truck tarps, which makes it sustainable.
(Carry Hq, 2016)

<b>Disadvantages</b>
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to Mica Dorfner (2016), the weight of school supplies the students carry may lead to sore
joints and muscles. Typically, students carry backpack loads weighing fifteen percent (15%) or more
of their body weight. In addition to this, a study conducted shows that, generally, students carry more
than ten percent (10%) of their own weight. The observation was noted in different countries and the
results always ranged from five to ten percent. All this may be due to the fact that there is no
universal recommendation for the weight limit. Therefore, parents and students do not control the
weight of the backpacks (Barbosa et al., 2021).
<br />
<br />
<br />
According to Hindawi, carrying heavy backpacks to school might be causing poor body posture. In
fact, the weight of school backpacks is becoming a growing concern recently among healthcare
professionals as well as school administrations. They come up with a solution, which is to decrease
the workload, or the weight of the backpack (F.M.A. Hossain et al., 2017).
<br />
<br />
<br />
Similarly, a study from Science daily explaining that the pressure of heavy loads of the bag carried
on the back can potentially damage the shoulder’s soft tissues which can cause microstructural
damage to the nerves. (American Friends of Tel Aviv University, 2013)
<br />
<br />
<br />
In support of the previous studies, according to the Reader’s Digest, around eighty percent (80%) of
adults experience lower back pain at some point in their lives. Carrying heavy items has something
to do with it. A heavy backpack affects the posture after a long period of time. That will not end there.
The wear and tear caused by a heavy backpack can go way beyond back pain. It increases the
chance of acquiring arthritis, it weakens the core muscles, and a heavy backpack may lead to
headaches (Carrie Madormo, 2021).
<br />
<br />
<br />
The researchers found out that although the problem seems important. Most of the articles are in
favor of the beneficial impact of the product. Therefore, the researchers argue that all the benefits
from this study do outweigh the drawbacks.
