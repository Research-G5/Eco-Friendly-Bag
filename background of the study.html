        <p align="left" class="background"><font size="5"> A typical backpack is simply a fabric sack carried on oneâ€™s back and also secured with two straps
          that go over the shoulders. It is commonly used by students for carrying loads or some sort of
          equipment. Moreover, a large and small backpack are used to carry things on the back, especially
          when walking or commuting. Through the years, backpacks have become more and more innovative. Many backpacks are created for a specific purpose, for instance, anti-theft backpacks,
          sports backpacks, hiking backpacks, pet backpacks, and so on.
            <br />
            <br />
            According to Sam (2020), a normal backpack is typically made from modified plastic-like materials
            that will likely become a problem once the backpack is damaged and thrown in the garbage because
            it lasts a hundred years in the environment.
            <br />
            <br />
            To aid the problem, the researchers will propose a new type of backpack that is made of non-
            polluting eco-friendly materials that emerge rapidly and whose purpose is to help in reducing the
            severity of the serious environmental crisis the world is currently facing. Furthermore, while a few
            backpacks may be convenient for drafting students, there is no particular backpack for them.
            Therefore, the researchers aim to develop and utilize an eco-friendly and sustainable backpack that
            could be the perfect bag for drafting students at Marikina Polytechnic College.
